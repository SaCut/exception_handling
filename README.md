# Error Handling in Python
When writing code, one way or another you're going to run into errors. Some, you'll be able to fix by writing the code a little differently. In other cases, the error might be caused by a user or otherwise be invevitable. In these cases we need a way to deal with them so that the user isn't left with incomprehensible error messages.  
This is where error handling comes in.

## Try, except
In Python, the way to handle errors works a lot like an ``if``/``else`` statement. The keywords are ``try``, ``except``, ``else``, and ``finally``.  

Below is an example of trying to open a file. If ``orders.txt`` doesn't exist, the file in the ``except`` block is run. This is much more useful to the average user than a ``FileNotFoundError``.
```python
try:
    # built in method for opening files - open("filename")
    file = open("orders.txt")
    print("File opened!")
except:
    # this is run when the code in the try block raises an exception
    print("Couldn't find the file. Make sure your file exists...")
```
Code in the ``finally`` block is ***always*** run.
